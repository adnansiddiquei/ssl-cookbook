# SSL Cookbook
An educational cookbook of SSL (self-supervised learning) paradigms.

This project serves as an educational reference to the most common cutting edge SSL techniques.
It contains examples across multiple techniques, applied to multiple modalities.
Each section explores through the theory from the ground up, starting with simple `pytorch`
(with `pytorch-lightning`) examples and working up towards reproducing recent papers within the field.
All of the examples are self-contained you should be able read, analyse and run them.
References to the original papers are provided wherever concepts are used, and a complete reference 
is provided at the bottom of this page.

## Environment Set-up
Poetry is used to manage the dependencies for this project. [Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) 
and run `poetry install`, followed by `poetry shell` to install the depenedencies and enter the 
virtual environment.
